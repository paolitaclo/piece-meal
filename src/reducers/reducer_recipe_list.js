You can cook the tops of the oyster mushrooms too but they don't look like scallops or use them in another recipe, like our oyster mushroom po' boy sandwich! You should be left with approximately 14 medallions.`,

          'In a bowl combine 3 cups of hot water with the vinegar(s) and submerge the mushroom scallops in the mixture for 30 minutes at room temperature. Place a small bowl or plate that fits within the main bowl on top to push the mushrooms into the liquid, ensuring they\'re submerged and not floating.',

          'While the mushrooms are marinating toss roughly chopped kale with 1 tbsp olive oil and 1 tbsp lemon juice. Bake for 6 to 8 minutes until crispy but still green. Bake time may vary based on your oven, but watch it closely. Once baked lower the oven temperature to low or warming (approx. 170F) and set the kale aside until you\'re ready to assemble the whole dish.',
          'Cook the pasta until al dente and reserve 1 cup of water for creating the sauce. Drain the pasta (do not rinse) and let it sit in a colander until the scallops and sauce are done.',
          'Heat a large pan to medium with 1 tbsp olive oil, or vegan butter. Place the mushroom medallions in the pan and brown on one side for 4 to 6 minutes. Depending on how much moisture your scallops absorbed this could take longer. Just before you flip them add 1/4 teaspoon sea salt and ground pepper. They should be golden brown on the first side when flipped. Then brown on the other side for 4 to 6 minutes and season with a pinch of salt and pepper again near the end. Remove the scallops from the pan and place in an oven safe plate/dish and place them in the oven to stay warm while you complete the sauce.',
          'Turn the heat under this pan down to medium-low if it’s become quite hot from cooking the scallops. Immediately add another 1 tbsp olive oil or vegan butter, and shallots, garlic, and leek. Sauté this for 2-3 minutes until fragrant, stirring frequently being sure not to burn the garlic and shallot. Then mix in oregano, basil, and chili peppers, cooking for another 1-2 minutes. Add in white wine and pasta water. Bring the heat back up to medium (if you need to) to simmer, stirring frequently for 10-12 minutes as the sauce reduces. Add 1/2 teaspoon sea salt and 1/4 teaspoon ground pepper near the end.',
          'Reduce the heat to low and toss the cooked spaghetti noodles in the sauce for 1-2 minutes until evenly coated and most of the sauce is absorbed. Transfer the pasta to serving dishes and top with crispy kale, scallops, and pomegranates. Drizzle with a little more olive oil if desired. Serve immediately!']
